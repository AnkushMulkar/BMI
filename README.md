# BMI Calculator and Recommendations
This is a Streamlit app that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides exercise, yoga, pranayama, and food recommendations based on the BMI category.

# Introduction
The BMI Calculator and Recommendations app is designed to help users calculate their BMI and get personalized health recommendations based on their BMI category. The app takes inputs such as weight in kilograms, height in feet and inches, and gender to calculate BMI. It then categorizes the BMI into four categories: "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," and "Obese." Based on the BMI category, the app provides exercise types, yoga poses, pranayama techniques, and food recommendations to maintain or improve their health.
